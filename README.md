The idea behind this project is to create a basic login and registration process, including (login with Facebook,Twitter,Google plus...) whit different backends (Custom, Parse.com, baasbox.com...) in an Android Studio module which will be included as part of a main application.

It will re-use the views, form fields validation and login/registration screens flow with different backend implementations.

Currently there is a implementation of the backend using Parse.com using username, password and profile picture.
