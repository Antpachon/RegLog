The idea behind this project is to create a basic login and registration process, including (login with Facebook,Twitter,Google plus...) whit different backends (Custom, Firebase.io, Parse.com, baasbox.com...) in an Android Studio module which will be included as part of a main application.

It will re-use the views, form fields validation and login/registration screens flow with different backend implementations.

Currently there is a implementation of the backend using Parse.com and a implementation using Firebase.io, both using authentication and registration with username, password and profile picture.

Update #1
A couple of days after uploading this project parse.com announces is going to stop the service. Terrible timing.
Service will be still running until Jan 2017 and it's possible to run parse in your own server 
so we will leave the implementation in the project.

Firebase.io implementation has been added as the default backend.
